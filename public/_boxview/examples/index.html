			<h3>Please remember that...</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>BoxView and the History Box can re-open only boxes loaded through Ajax, basicly all of the examples
					where you see some dog.</li>
				<li>For the same reason, when you try to use an URL of a boxview (either short or long) to open a new 
					page, the boxview will load only boxes that can be loaded through Ajax calls.</li>
				<li>In all of the examples where AnchorMan is used, your browser's back button will undo your
					last BoxView interaction: collapse, open, close a box or reorder them.</li>
				<li>To make the Ajax examples work, the database file and the directory containing it, must be
					writable by the webserver user (or chmod a+w examples/data_providers/ examples/data_providers/db.sqlite
					if you feel brave enough!). You will also need your webserver to load the php sqlite module!</li>
			</ul>

						<p> Initialize the Suite and let it load the components .. </p>
						<p> Uses the boxview defaults -- read: this example has no custom configuration file.
							The logic to add boxes is hard coded in the html page.</p>

						<p>A BoxView with very fast animations, AnchorMan and the built-in URL shortener</p>
						<p>Open some boxes, drag them around and check your browser's back button: it will reverse
							your actions. Did you close by mistake box? Click back and .. here it is! Get a shortened
							URL for this exact page, and try open it in a new window: exactly the same boxes will pop out.</p>

					<td>
						<p>A bunch of links to open boxes, each one configured differently. One cant be dragged around, the next
							cant be closed. A third refuses to be collapsed. And the mighty WIN box, which cant
							be collapsed, closed neither dragged and spawns in first position, no matter what!</p>
						<p>Open some boxes, drag them around and see how they behave differently. Note that the WIN box
							is the only one with a given 'resId', so it can be opened just once.</p>

						<p>An example on how to use just the Boxview component of the suite. Initialization,
							styling and interaction logic are coded directly in the HTML page.</p>
						<p>An animated boxview on the upper part of the page, one without on the bottom.</p>
						<p>Click the links, drag'n'drop the boxes around, collapse and close them and try
							resizing the window as well: the boxviews will just follow.</p>
