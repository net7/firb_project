BoxView Release Candidate 3

- Cleaned and sorted examples and (a bit of) documentation
- Removed old and unused themes
- Widgets and BoxViews now work again together like good old friends
- Added license information in every file

** ATTENTION: important change from RC2 ** 

- Changed BoxStrapper() accepted parameters to:
 1st. path where to find the boxview (nothing changed here)
 2nd. object with user's options (used to be a path to user's configuration file)
- The object can contain the following fields:
 - userConfig: path to user's configuration file
 - themePath: path to user's themes
- All of the given paths are relative to the file where you are writing them.
- For example: 

   BoxStrapper('../BoxView/', // BoxView tree can be found here
      { userConfig: '../myConfig.js', // My personal configuration file
        themePath: '../myThemes/' // My themes are stored here
   })


BoxView Release Candidate 2

- BoxToolbar component up and running, in most of the examples
- defaults icons in boxtoolbar: history box and urlshortener
- history box code reviewed to enforce expected behaviors
- fixed a bug preventing the users to set a different boxview name in their config
- added examples on how to customize boxes and widgets behaviors and make up
- UrlShortener adds himself to the global scope automaticly, ready to be used
- modified suite component load order to allow boxview to take advantage of widgets
- not opening boxes with addBoxFromAjax if there's no valid query string
